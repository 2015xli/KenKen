# A simple solver for KenKen (KenDoku) 
 
 For SuDoKu solutions, input an integer that represents the matrix size, such as:
 ```java
 java Kenken 5
 ```
 It outputs all the SuDoKu solutions for 5x5 matrix.
 
 For KenKen solutions, provide a file that encodes a KenKen problem, such as:
 ```java
 java Kenken input/kenken.5
 ```
 It uses file ./input/kenken.5 as input and computes its solution.
 
The package includes a few example files for KenKen problems under ./input directory. 
Please just follow them to create your own KenKen problems.
